## TL;DR

There are many great articles written about the *Seam Carving algorithm* already, but I couldn't resist a temptation to explore this elegant, powerful and *yet simple* algorithm on my own, and to write about my personal experience with it. Another point that drew my attention (as a creator of [javascript-algorithms](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms) repo) was the fact that *Dynamic Programming (DP)* approach might be smoothly applied to solve it. And if you're like me and still on your "learning algorithms" journey, this algorithmic solution may enrich your personal DP arsenal.

So, with this article I want to do three things:

1. Provide you with an interactive **content-aware resizer** so that you could play around with resizing of your own images
2. Explain the idea behind the **Seam Carving algorithm**
3. Explain the **dynamic programming approach** that implements the algorithm

### Content-aware image resizing

*Content-aware image resizing* might be applied when it comes to changing the image proportions (i.e. reducing the width while keeping the height) and when losing some parts of the image is not desirable. Doing the straightforward image scaling in this case would distort the objects in it. To preserve the objects proportions while changing the image proportions we may use the [Seam Carving algorithm](https://perso.crans.org/frenoy/matlab2012/seamcarving.pdf) that was introduced by *Shai Avidan* and *Ariel Shamir*.

In the example below you may see how the original image width was reduced by 50% using content-aware resizing (left image) and straightforward scaling (right image). In this particular case the left image looks more natural since proportions of the balloons were preserved.

The idea behind the Seam Carving algorithm is to find the *seam* (continuous sequence of pixels) with the lowest contribution to the image content and then *carve* (remove) it. This process repeats over and over again until we get the required image width or height. In the example below you may see that the hot air balloon pixels contribute more to the content of the image than the sky pixels. Thus, the sky pixels are being removed first.

Finding the seam with the lowest energy is pretty computationally expensive task (especially for large images). To make the seam search faster the *dynamic programming* approach might be applied (we will go through the implementation details below).

### Objects removal

The importance of each pixel (so-called pixel's energy) is being calculated based on its color (`R`, `G`, `B`) difference between two neighbor pixels. Now, if we set the pixel energy to some really low level artificially (i.e. by drawing a mask on top of them), the Seam Carving algorithm would perform an **object removal** for us for free.

### JS IMAGE CARVER demo

I've created the [JS IMAGE CARVER](https://trekhleb.dev/js-image-carver) web-app that you may use to play around with the resizing of your custom images. You may also try its embed version below right away! This widget uses the Seam Carving algorithm that we're going to explore in this article.

### More examples

Here are some more examples of how the algorithm copes with more complex backgrounds.

Mountains on the background are being shrunk smoothly without visible seams.

The same goes for the ocean waves. Algorithm preserved the waves structure without distorting the surfers.

But also we need to keep in mind that the Seam Carving algorithm is not a silver bullet, and it may fail to resize the images where most of the pixels are edges (looks important to the algorithm). In this case it starts distorting even the important parts of the image.
