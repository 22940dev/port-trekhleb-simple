Hello Readers!

For those of you who launched or plan to launch your next startup, I’ve created a [list of 50+ platforms you may use to promote your next project](https://github.com/trekhleb/promote-your-next-startup) for free.

Of course, it is far from perfect and from being complete. In my opinion, there is only one perfect advertisement channel, and it is **people who are in love with your product**. Their sharing activities is the best advertisement. But, this list of platforms mentioned in the repository may be a good starting point for spreading the word about something you’ve done.

All links there are split by the following actions:

* Post News
* Create Product Page
* Post an Article
* Write for News Blog
* Answer Questions
* Write to Dev-Chats
* Become Awesome
* Register in Startup Directories

I also put short descriptions for each resource that might help you to pick the right platform for your marketing strategy.

I hope you find [promote-your-next-startup](https://github.com/trekhleb/promote-your-next-startup) repository useful.

Happy promotion!
