Enough time for work, for family, for personal projects, for rest. I hope that you do know such people or maybe you’re the one. But in my case I constantly see how me personally and people I know are complaining that there is not enough time to do this or that.</p>\n<p>We’re all given a gift of time. Everyone of us receives the <strong>gift of 24 hours</strong> each morning. There is no way to increase this number. The only thing we can do is to spend it more <strong>productively</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>I’m sure that you’ve read and practiced a lot of productivity related techniques.

There is only 2–3 free hours left for personal projects. The important thing here is that all of mentioned below have been done during those free several hours per day. So here are some “fruits” that I’ve “reaped” so far after “sowing” the principles mentioned below in this article:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I’ve created <a href=\"https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms\">JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures</a> repository — the 25k+ stars project was the most trending repository of the week on GitHub (as for May 25th), and the most trending repository of the month (as for June 15th) with the peak of 5000 stars per day. This project contains JavaScript examples of classic data-structures and algorithms for learning purpose.</li>\n<li>I’ve launched <a href=\"http://allbible.info/\">AllBible Project</a> — online Bible study web-service. The project that lives by itself for 8 years already without any advertisement, and it still serves for 5k+ users every day and that had users from 180 countries already.</li>\n<li>I’ve created <a href=\"https://github.com/trekhleb/angular-library-seed\">Angular Library Seed</a> — project that helped people to create their own Angular 2 libraries.</li>\n<li>I’ve launched <a href=\"https://aggregatus.io/\">Aggregatus</a> — the service that helps you to aggregate data from many web-sites into one searchable, sortable and filterable collections. This project isn’t finished yet and has a lot of things to do so far. But the biggest gain I’ve got from it is precious experience.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>First of all, I can’t and I won’t call these items successful</strong>. The reason for that is simple — you and only you must decide what success means to you. Your definition of success will be the right one for you. Not for others. Work in outsource company? Work in product company? Work in Google? Work in small but perspective start-up? Create your own start-up? Spend more time with family? Be happy with what you’ve got? It is completely up to you.</p>\n<p>Thus, if nothing from above has attracted your attention or has fit to your definitions of success then please just skip this article and don’t read further. Really. Don’t waste your time and do something that will bring you closer to your success goals instead.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-seeds-i-sowed-so-far\" style=\"position:relative;\">The “seeds” I sowed so far<a href=\"#the-seeds-i-sowed-so-far\" aria-label=\"the seeds i sowed so far permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Try to define what success means to you. Say NO to things that out of your definitions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Continuing the previous section it seems really important to decide what do you want to get from your life? What is success to you? What your definition of success? Try to define it. This will help you to prioritize your life. And be responsible for your definition of success now and in 20, 30, 40+ years from now. After you’ll have your definitions of success it would be much easier to say NO to certain time consumers. Thus, to become more focused on the things that really matters to you. For instance your family might be really important to you. If relationship in your family is a part of your life success then you might probably need to say NO to heat another team-building with team-mates.</p>\n<h3 id=\"find-out-your-passion\" style=\"position:relative;\">Find out your passion<a href=\"#find-out-your-passion\" aria-label=\"find out your passion permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>This one is yet another that is hard for me to describe.</p>\n<p>You need to have something inside of you that will be like an engine that will make you do “things” continuously.</p>\n<p>I like what Joyce Meyer said once. She said something like: <em>“The things that you do every day will make you a winner. Not the things that you do occasionally”</em>. This is so true as for me. You need to have something inside of you that will make you do “things” (do coding?) on weekends, at 5 AM, or during lunch. Something you’re ready to work on even without being paid for it.</p>\n<p>Think about it. Do you have something you just <strong>do</strong> continuously? Without somebody asking you or forcing you to do it. Whether it is cooking or coding or writing.

The main idea here is when you’ve achieved something (small or big) just fix it somehow and make it visible.</p>\n<p>First of all, this may serve others.
