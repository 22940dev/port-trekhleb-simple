Let me explain my point...</p>\n<h2>Imagine you want to have bigger muscles</h2>\n<p>You currently can bear 50 kg on bench press. This is your <strong>limit</strong>. What if your <strong>ambition</strong> tells you that you need to try 100 kg on bench press right away to get bigger. This weight (read “ambition”) will smash you, right? Instead, you need to constantly extend your 50 kg limit by trying to do more push-ups or by adding 1 kg next time you do the training. This will make your <strong>limits</strong> grow. Eventually you’ll get to your desired 100 kg of lifting weight.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1000px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 70.8%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"muscles ambition\"\n        title=\"muscles ambition\"\n        src=\"/static/e318d0f69af3f8f2e6a48b00b1195f49/a2510/02-muscles.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/e318d0f69af3f8f2e6a48b00b1195f49/0479a/02-muscles.jpg 250w,\n/static/e318d0f69af3f8f2e6a48b00b1195f49/41099/02-muscles.jpg 500w,\n/static/e318d0f69af3f8f2e6a48b00b1195f49/a2510/02-muscles.jpg 1000w,\n/static/e318d0f69af3f8f2e6a48b00b1195f49/d165a/02-muscles.jpg 1400w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<center><i>\nPhoto by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/Yi-4X9ZJU6Y?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Kyle Johnson</a>\n</i></center>\n<h2>Imagine you want to have an expensive car</h2>\n<p>Expensiveness is a variable for everyone of us because we all have different <strong>limits</strong>. But let’s assume that you worked hard and got $10k on your bank account during last 3 years. Now, your <strong>ambitions</strong> tell you that you want $20k car and want it right now. You’re getting a loan and finally buying it. Seems like you made it. But you worked for 3 years to get just half of required money. Doesn’t it look like jumping over the head? Now you have a loan, and you need to give away a good portion of your monthly income. Then you get to service station and start wondering why all those car parts and services are so expensive. Your ambitions start smashing you down month after month. What just happened? Your ambition was much bigger than your limits. You’ve just bought a shoes of size XL while you’re comfortably wearing S. What if instead of buying such an expensive car we would buy a cheaper one that fits to our <strong>limits</strong>? It will make us much happier afterwards, won’t it? Or what if we would just finish another professional courses and get higher paid job. This would expend your <strong>limits</strong> and eventually it will make you capable to bear $20k, $30k, … cars easily.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1000px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 66%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"car ambition\"\n        title=\"car ambition\"\n        src=\"/static/7783712d4ac63937c2058c6ad419262e/a2510/03-car.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/7783712d4ac63937c2058c6ad419262e/0479a/03-car.jpg 250w,\n/static/7783712d4ac63937c2058c6ad419262e/41099/03-car.jpg 500w,\n/static/7783712d4ac63937c2058c6ad419262e/a2510/03-car.jpg 1000w,\n/static/7783712d4ac63937c2058c6ad419262e/d165a/03-car.jpg 1400w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<center><i>\nPhoto by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/moheR9rdRGY?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">A.

Being a great developer means that you’ve extended your limits. Imagine you were “lucky” and during the screening interview you got a problem to solve that you’ve already known. The only problem your knew. Again, looks like you’ve made it. Let’s pretend (even though it sounds not realistic of course) that you didn’t have on-site interview, and you’ve got an offer by just being “lucky” with your one and only solution you know. What will happen next? You’ll need to bear with extremely hard problems and quick pace every day, but you know only one solution. It will bring a lot of stress into your life because your ambitions were much higher than your limits.
