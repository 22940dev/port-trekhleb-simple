## Development

### Icons

Use [react-icons.github.io](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons) to search for available icons.

### Custom Domain Support

To serve the [trekhleb.github.io](https://trekhleb.github.io) web-site on a custom domain [trekhleb.dev](https://trekhleb.dev) make sure that the `publish` branch has `CNAME` file in the root folder.
